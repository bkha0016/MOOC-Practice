(define-struct bag (l w h))
;; Bag is (make-bag Number Number Number)
;; interp. a bag with a length, width and height in centimeters
(define B1 (make-bag 19.5 10.0 6.5))

; PROBLEM:
;
; The linear length of a bag is defined to be it length plus
; width plus height. Design the function linear-length-lob that consumes
; a list of bags and produces a list of the linear lengths of each of
; the bags in the list.
;
; Use at least one built-in abstract function and encapsulate any helper
; functions in a local expression.


(define (linear-length-lob lob)
  (local [(define (linear-length b)
            (+ (bag-l b) (bag-w b) (bag-h b)))]
    (map linear-length lob)))


(linear-length-lob LOB2)
