; In this exercise you will be need to remember the following DDs
; for an image organizer.
;


;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(define-struct dir (name sub-dirs images))
;; Dir is (make-dir String ListOfDir ListOfImage)
;; interp. An directory in the organizer, with a name, a list
;;         of sub-dirs and a list of images.

;; ListOfDir is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Dir ListOfDir)
;; interp. A list of directories, this represents the sub-directories of
;;         a directory.

;; ListOfImage is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Image ListOfImage)
;; interp. a list of images, this represents the sub-images of a directory.
;; NOTE: Image is a primitive type, but ListOfImage is not.

(define I1 (square 10 "solid" "red"))
(define I2 (square 12 "solid" "green"))
(define I3 (rectangle 13 14 "solid" "blue"))
(define D4 (make-dir "D4" empty (list I1 I2)))
(define D5 (make-dir "D5" empty (list I3)))
(define D6 (make-dir "D6" (list D4 D5) empty))

;; =================
;; Functions:

;
; PROBLEM A:
;
; Design an abstract fold function for Dir called fold-dir.
;

(define (fold-dir c1 c2 b e)
  (local [(define (fn-for-element e)
            (c1 (elt-name e)    ;String
                 (elt-data e)    ;Integer
                 (fn-for-loe (elt-subs e))))

          (define (fn-for-loe loe)
            (cond [(empty? loe) b]
                  [else
                   (c2 (fn-for-element (first loe))
                        (fn-for-loe (rest loe)))]))]
    (fn-for-element e)))



;
; PROBLEM B:
;
; Design a function that consumes a Dir and produces the number of
; images in the directory and its sub-directories.
; Use the fold-dir abstract function.
;



;
; PROBLEM C:
;
; Design a function that consumes a Dir and a String. The function looks in
; dir and all its sub-directories for a directory with the given name. If it
; finds such a directory it should produce true, if not it should produce false.
; Use the fold-dir abstract function.
;


;
; PROBLEM D:
;
; Is fold-dir really the best way to code the function from part C? Why or
; why not?
