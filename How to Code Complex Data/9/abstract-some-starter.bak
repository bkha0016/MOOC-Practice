; PROBLEM:
;
; Design an abstract function called some-pred? (including signature, purpose,
; and tests) to simplify the following two functions. When you are done
; rewrite the original functions to use your new some-pred? function.
;


;; ListOfNumber -> Boolean
;; produce true if some number in lon is positive
(check-expect (some-positive? empty) false)
(check-expect (some-positive? (list 2 -3 -4)) true)
(check-expect (some-positive? (list -2 -3 -4)) false)

(define (some-positive? lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) false]
        [else
         (or (positive? (first lon))
             (some-positive? (rest lon)))]))


;; ListOfNumber -> Boolean
;; produce true if some number in lon is negative
(check-expect (some-negative? empty) false)
(check-expect (some-negative? (list 2 3 -4)) true)
(check-expect (some-negative? (list 2 3 4)) false)
